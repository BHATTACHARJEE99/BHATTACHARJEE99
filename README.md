# About Me:
I’m currently working on building business intelligence dashboards and analytics pipelines using SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Python, with a focus on turning raw data into clear, decision-ready insights through academic and applied projects.<br>I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics, BI reporting, data quality, and governance-related initiatives, especially projects that sit at the intersection of business context and technical execution.<br>I’m looking for help with learning from industry professionals and practitioners in analytics, enterprise data platforms, and scalable data foundations, particularly around metrics design and AI-ready analytics.<br>I’m currently learning advanced analytics concepts, data engineering fundamentals, and mainframe systems including COBOL, JCL, and IBM z/OS, while continuing to strengthen my understanding of data governance and analytics best practices.<br>Ask me about SQL, Power BI, Tableau, data storytelling, dashboard design, and building analytics solutions that support real business decisions.<br>Fun fact: outside of work and academics, I enjoy playing golf and wakeboarding whenever I get the chance.
